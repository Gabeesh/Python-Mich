Thank you for enrolling in Python Data Structures. This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of my free textbook titled, 'Programming for Informatics: Exploring Information' (www.pythonlearn.com). This course is equivalent to the second half of the 11-week 'Programming for Everybody (Python)' course.We have put a lot of detail about the course into the document titled 'Syllabus' which can be found in Week 1, so please take a moment to review it.
